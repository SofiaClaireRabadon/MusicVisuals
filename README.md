# Description of the assignment
The song I have chosen is called Rave Machine by Tony Junior, BEAUZ. The type of genre is Electronic and the style of the song is Happy Hardcore which means it is a Hardcore Dance Music. 

I created 4 different visuals based on how I interpret the whole song including the lyrics. 

# Instructions
- Pressing the R key = To REWIND the whole song
- Pressing the P key = To PAUSE the song 
- Pressing the C key = To CONTINUE the song where it was last paused
- Pressing the 0, 1, 2, and 3 keys = Displays each different visual based on how I interpret the song.
